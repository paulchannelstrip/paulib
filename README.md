## Paul's Personal Tidal Cycles library

I'll be updating this as I go along, hopefully getting it to a point where it's easy to pull and use immediately. The `samples` submodule is my personal sample library. I'm not sure about licensing for most of the samples included, so it will remain private for the time being.

Feel free to copy anything you see here! Some of it was copied from kindohm, others from jarmlib, and still others from elsewhere. I'll take time to include links to my sources soon. At present this is mostly a way for me to easily move my setup to a new (old) laptop.
